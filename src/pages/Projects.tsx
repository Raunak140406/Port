    date: "Jan 2024 - Apr 2024",
    description: "This was my first-ever project when I joined NTU, and I was super pumped to dive into it – especially since it was in Java! I had all sorts of cool ideas in mind, ready to build an awesome food delivery app with a smooth, user-friendly experience. But, as with all great stories, fate had other plans. Somehow, I ended up with the best teammates (yes only I worked) and pushed through this project. Classic way to kick off my journey at NTU, right? This project revolves around JAVA and is strictly designed to obey all the OOP Principles.",

    date: "Sept 2024 - Nov 2024",
    description: "OrbitWise was the project where I really saw the magic happen when you combine Computer Science, AI, and Aerospace. I developed this machine learning-powered tool to predict exoplanetary orbital periods, using models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and a Stacking Ensemble. The goal was to provide a scalable and efficient way to analyze exoplanet orbits, helping researchers identify Earth-like planets. This project wasn't just about the tech – it was my first real dive into how AI could push the boundaries of space research, and I had a blast working with my teammates.",

    date: "Sept 2024 - Dec 2024",
    description: "MediMap+ has been one of the best experiences so far at NTU. It's a healthcare platform that I along with my team developed to improve accessibility and support health and wellness in Singapore. The project was my first full-stack, fully functional professional project. The website has some pretty cool features, like a smart hospital locator with customizable filters, a resource hub for First Aid education, and an appointment booking system that makes scheduling both online and offline a breeze. Beyond the technical side, I learned a ton about teamwork, managing pressure, and most importantly, how to build a fully functional app from scratch.",

    date: "Jan 2025 - May 2025",
    description: "WaryPotter has definitely been one of my favorite projects to date – mostly because it's the first time I ventured into building a hardware prototype! But it's not just your average pothole detector; it's part of a revolutionary safety ecosystem. WaryPotter is a small, portable device that can be mounted on your bike. It detects potholes and alerts the cyclist about their presence 15-20 meters in advance, giving them enough time to slow down and avoid accidents. The heart of the device is a Raspberry Pi, which runs a neural network model to identify potholes, confirmed by a LiDAR that measures sudden dips in the road. Leading the team on this was an unforgettable experience.",
